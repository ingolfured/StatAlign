/**
 * Objects of this class can be used in place of a Thread object if it is intended that
 * they can be stopped or suspended "softly" by an external thread. This means that if an
 * external thread requests termination of this thread (by calling stopSoft()),
 * execution will continue up to the first "stopping point", i.e. the first call of
 * stoppable() from within this thread.
 * At this point, a StoppedException will be thrown, and the StoppableThread will be given
 * the chance to catch it at an arbitrary point and do up before termination.
 * 
 * In every other aspect, a StoppableThread is like a Thread, e.g. you should override
 * run() and place your "softly stoppable" code there. But you must declare your run()
 * method <code>synchronized</code> for most of the above to work properly.
 * 
 * The easiest way to define "stopping points" and "pausing points" in your own classes
 * is to use Stoppable as the ancestor and call its stoppable() and pausable() methods from
 * your methods.
