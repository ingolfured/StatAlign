/**
 * Common ancestor for post-processing plugin classes.

 * Comments for plugin developers:
 *  <ul><li> Implement the abstract class. You can use the boolean variables
 *           to tell the main program what your plugin is supposed to do.
 *      <li> Via the mcmc variable, you can reach the tree and eventually all
 *           its public variables, so you can collect information about the current state
 *           of the Markov chain
 *      <li> If you would like to make a GUI for this postprocess plugin, return with its
 *           JPanel in the getJPanel() function
 *      <li> The implemented subclass must handle the information gathered and needed 
 *           for the postprocessing. Neither the Mcmc class, nor the PostprocessManager class
 *           collects information about the state of the Markov chain!
 *  </ul>
